# Project: Members Only


In this project, we build an exclusive clubhouse where members can write posts about non-members.  Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. You can get the full project description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).
