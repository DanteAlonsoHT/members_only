# Project: Members Only


In this project, we build an exclusive blog where members can write posts about non-members or whatever.  Inside this app, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it. You can get the full project description [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication).

This project uses devise gem to create the authentication in Ruby on Rails, you can learn more about it in this project, how to use it and how to make relations in the database with the Users table created by the gem devise. We encourage you to use it because it's the easiest way to make a complete authentication, and you can customize it if you want to do it.
